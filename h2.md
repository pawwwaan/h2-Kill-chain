# Read and Summarize

## Abstract
- Kill chain: attacks happen in **stages**, not single events.  
- Each stage gives defenders a chance to **detect and disrupt**.  
- Using intelligence about adversaries improves defenses.  
- Blocking even one stage can stop the whole attack.

## Section 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain  
- Seven stages:  
  1. Reconnaissance  
  2. Weaponization  
  3. Delivery  
  4. Exploitation  
  5. Installation  
  6. Command & Control  
  7. Actions on Objectives  
- Defenders can act on each stage, not only at the end.  

  ### My own question 
  Which stage of the kill chain is usually the hardest for defenders to detect, and why?

  # Tactics, Tools and Procedures
  - **Tactic** = goal of an attacker.  
  - Example: *Exfiltration*.  

- **Technique** = how an attacker achieves a tactic.  
  - Example: *Exfiltration Over Web Services (T1567)*.  

- **Sub-technique** = a specific variant of a technique.  
  - Example: *Exfiltration to Cloud Storage (T1567.002)*.  

- **Procedure** = real-world execution.  
  - Example: Attacker uploads payroll files to Dropbox using a script.  

**Comment:** ATT&CK Matrix is like a “menu” of attacker actions — and for defenders, it’s also a checklist of where monitoring is needed.
